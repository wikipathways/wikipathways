This package is the SocialRewarding extension for MediaWiki. The
focus is laid on generating benefits for users in order to
achieve a higher contribution rate in a wiki system. Therefore,
social rewarding mechanisms are implemented to reward people
contributing to an online community. In an online community
social rewarding is in the majority of cases based on
accentuation of the most active members. For example, ranking
of users' activities ("top contributors"). In this extension
four techniques has been designed: "Amount of References", "Most
Viewed Articles", "Rating of Articles" and a "Recommender
System". An in-depth explanation of social rewarding methods,
there design principles, and a technical description can be
found in the document named "SocialRewardingDocumentation.pdf"
which is included in the package and should be located in the
same directory as the extension.

GNU General Public License, version 2 or later (see

== Installation requirements ==

* A web-server (extension was tested on Apache 2.0.54).
* MediaWiki 1.6 or higher (extension was tested with 1.6.0,
  1.6.7, 1.7.1 and 1.10.0; with some little adaptations the
  extension should work on older versions, too).
* PHP 4.3 or higher; 5.x is recommended (extension was tested
  with PHP 4.3.5 and 5.1.4). If you use a PHP version prior 5
  social rewarding method "Amount of References" is disabled
  automatically because of a nonexistent SOAP interface.
* A MySQL server 4.0 or higher (extension was tested with MySQL
  4.0.18).

The SocialRewarding extension was developed on Apache 2.0.54 with
MediaWiki 1.6.7 and 1.10.0 respectively, PHP 5.1.4, and
MySQL 4.0.18.

The extension may work with older software products, but then
it can be that not all features are available. However, to
minimize problems it is recommended that you always use the
latest stable release of all software products.

For security reasons please turn register_globals = Off in your
php.ini. Neither MediaWiki nor the SocialRewarding extension
need register_globals to be enabled.


== Installation ==

* Download a copy of the zipped SocialRewarding package.
* Unpack all files to the extension directory of your MediaWiki
  installation (e.g. [MediaWikiPath]/extensions/SocialRewarding/).
* To activate the SocialRewarding extension in MediaWiki you have
  to edit your [MediaWikiPath]/LocalSettings.php. Insert the
  following at the end of the file:
  require_once("extensions/SocialRewarding/SocialRewarding.php");
* Configure the SocialRewarding package by editing the file 
  SocialRewardingConfigDetail.php or SocialRewardingConfigShort.php
  depending wether you would like to have a detailed or only a
  short description of the configuration parameters. To enable one
  of the configuration files you have to edit the file
  SocialRewarding.php and un-/comment lines 43 or 44 where the
  short and the long version of the configuration files are loaded.
  The short version is loaded by default. Be sure to have your
  copy of the SocialRewarding extension configured correctly before
  moving on to the next step.
* For setting up social rewarding method Amount of References you
  have to obtain a license key from http://www.google.com/apis to
  be able to use Google's SOAP Search API (beta). The license key
  has to be inserted into the variable
  $SocialRewarding["references"]["googleKey"] in your configuration
  file.
* Now start your favorite web-browser and navigate to the
  installation script. The URL should be something like
  http://www.YourWebServer.org/MediaWiki/index.php/
  Special:SocialRewardingInstall.
  Alternatively, you can also reach the installation page if you
  browse the special pages of your MediaWiki and click on the link
  called "Social Rewarding: Installation".
* If you get an error while trying to reach the installation
  special page you probably have to copy all special pages of this
  package to the [MediaWikiPath]/includes/ directory. To identify
  special pages they are all starting with
  "SpecialSocialRewarding".
* Follow the instructions on the installation page. After you
  completed the installation successfully your SocialRewarding
  extension should work.
