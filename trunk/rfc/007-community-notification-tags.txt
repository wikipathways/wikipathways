== RFC 007: Community Notification Tags ==
We should implement a set of tags that users can post on any pathway, notifying the authors 
and the community about incomplete data or the status of the work.  These are analogous to 
the tags used in Wikipedia for the same purpose. Some of these could be very brief, others
could contain multiple sentences.

We should also implement bots to manage some of the tags to automatically notify users of
highlighted content, whether it might be 'new' or 'incomplete' or 'scheduled for deletion'.

== How Wikipedia Does It ==
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Template_messages/User_talk_namespace

Wikipedia uses templates to define the contents of tags for a broad range of purposes. The
templates are then simply referenced in any page by adding {{template_name}} to the text. Bots
handle a significant portion of the template usage. Note that templates are referenced "in real time" 
as each page is rendered, this is called transclusion. This can put a strain on the server. Wikipedia 
recommends using substitution to remedy this. Substitution simply replaces the template reference 
with the contents of the template into the target. Substitution can be implemented by simply
preceding the the template name with 'subst:', e.g., {{subst:template_name}}.  When using substitution,
you'll notice the contents of the template copied into the page when editing that page. This
also effectively disconnects the template reference from the template. So, when the template is changed
the change is NOT reflected in the target page. This is OK for simple or temporary tags, but not for
templates like the ones that generate the header and footer of every Pathway Page, i.e., we want changes
to those to be reflected in the target pages.

== Implementation ==
1. Since our pathway pages are rendered from GPML and Pathway Page Templates, we will have to add
   an applet to the Top page template to handle the template tags, so that they are added to the
   rendered page without being in the GPML.
2. Create three pages for template-based tag listings:
   a. User tags: tags we want users to use
   b. Admin tags: tags for admins to use
   c. Bot tags: tags for bots to use
   Note that there is overlapping usage across these categories such that Admins can use User tags, and
   Bots can use Admin and User tags; the categories help to distinguish which tags cannot be used by Users
   (e.g., Admin and Bot tags) and which should be automatic only (Bot tags).
3. Create template-based tags and reference them (via transclusion) in the appropriate list pages
4. Create bots to use bot tags
5. Use Admin tags
6. Introduce user tags via Help pages
