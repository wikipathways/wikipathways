These tags are partially implemented using the same system as rfc 007:metatags,
but require a permission scheme to prevent people from assigning badges to themselves.


== Tagging User Pages aka Badges ==

 * Active User (e.g., based on activity over past 7 days)
 * Inactive User (e.g., not logged in for over 6 months)
 * New User (e.g., first 7 days)
 * Valued Contributor (e.g., X number of edits)
 * Pathway Powerhouse (e.g., X number of new pathways)

 * Curator
 * Admin
 * User with particular rights/responsibilities
 * Specific user group (Comment Kristina: For Portals, maybe there could be a way to assign all
 						new users registered through a certain portal as being part of that community.
 						For example if somebody creates an account under the Plant portal, the users
 						would automatically be tagged as being part of the plant community. If there isn't
 						a way to do this automatically, users could choose from a drop-down list of 
 						appropriate tags during registration).
