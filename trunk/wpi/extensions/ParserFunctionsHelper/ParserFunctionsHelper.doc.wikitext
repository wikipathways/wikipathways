== Purpose==
Provides services to parser function extensions which require inserting content after the parsing phase. 

This extension is meant to serve other extensions i.e. it does not provide end-user functionality by itself.

== Motivation ==
Parser functions can insert content during the parsing phase albeit not ''raw'' content i.e. content which should end-up untouched in the output page.

This extension allows for registering ''raw'' content which will replace ''anchors'' in the parsed wikitext.

== Usage ==

== Dependancy ==
